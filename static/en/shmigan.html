                    <h2>Shmigan Phonology</h2>

                    <p>Shmigan has no nasals and does not differentiate between
                    voicings. It has a lot of different fricatives. There are no
                    labial sounds whatsoever in shmigan (thouh some speakers
                    occasionally labialize /t/, /n/, and /&theta;/ to /p/, /m/,
                    and /f/ in certain situations).</p>

                    <p>Note that there is also the 'softer' Ugashmigan
                    pronounciation, in which /x/ is replaced with /y/ and /h/ is
                    replaced with /w/ additionally, the glottal stop is instead
                    used to create dipthongs between vowels. There is also the
                    'harder' Kashmigan pronounciation, where every sound that
                    can be voiced, is. Some English speakers are inclined to
                    pronounce the /x/ as /ks/ like the English letter X, this is
                    not accepted in Shmigan.</p>

                    <p>Shmigan contains only 5 vowels: close front unrounded,
                    close back rounded, open-mid front unrounded, close-mid back
                    rounded, and open front unrounded. There are no dipthongs in
                    shmigan (though some speakers replace vowel+h+vowel with a
                    dipthong.</p>

                    <p>As an onset, any consonant may appear. Additionally, the
                    voiceless alveolar fricative may appear followed by a
                    voiceless plosive, a nasal, the voiceles dental fricative,
                    the voiceless post alveolar fricative, or an approximant. On
                    top of that, a voiceless alveolar fricative followed by a
                    voiceless plosive may also be followed by the alveolar
                    approximant.</p>

                    <p>Codas can also contain any consonant. Additionally, all
                    double-consonant onsets may appear reversed in the coda.
                    Finally, a voiced alveolar plosive followed by a voiceless
                    alveolar plosive, an alveolar fricative followed by a
                    postalveolar fricative, or an alveolar approximant followed
                    by a lateral approximant may appear.</p>

                    <h2>Shmigan Alphabet</h2>

                    <p>Shmigan uses a compound alphabet, with the onset of a
                    syllable attached directly to its vowel. Only coda's appear
                    without a vowel. The vowels are: 
                    <span class="shmigan">i</span> /i/, 
                    <span class="shmigan">e</span> /e/,
                    <span class="shmigan">a</span> /a/,
                    <span class="shmigan">u</span> /u/, and
                    <span class="shmigan">o</span> /o/. They appear in what is
                    called the 'bucket' of the letter. </p>

                    <p>The 'head' of the letter indicates what type of consonant
                    cluster it represents. <span class="shmigan">^</span>
                    represents a simple cluster, <span class="shmigan">~</span>
                    represents an s-addition cluster, and <span
                        class="shmigan">*</span> represents a compound
                    cluster.</p>

                    <p>The alphabet is ordered by consonant, with vowels skipped
                    (so that dictionaries still work with the peculiar
                    derivational morphology). The names of each letter is just
                    the letter itself preceded by <span
                    class="shmigan">qi</span> As such, the entire alphabet, in
                    order, is (note: when two pronounciations appear, the second
                    is used only when no vowel is present):</p>

                    <h2>Conjugation</h2>

                    <p>Verbs in Shmigan have tense, aspect, voice, and mood.
                    They do not have number or persons, which are identified by
                    the nouns. The conjugation of the verb is indicated by a
                    single symbol appended to the beginning of the verb. Note on
                    dynamic vs static passive voices. A passive voice is static
                    if the subject is acted upon at a certain time, dynamic if
                    the subject got itself acted upon. Static passives tend to
                    use the word 'be' in english, while dynamic passives tend to
                    use the word 'get'. </p>

                    <h3>Tense</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan has 3 tenses: Past, Present, and Future. The
                    present is indicated by a simple prefix. The past is
                    indicated by an s-addition prefix. The future is indicated
                    by a compound prefix.</p>

                    <h3>Aspect</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan has 5 aspects: Simple, Perfect, Progressive,
                    Perfect Progressive, and Habitual. The Simple aspect is
                    indicated by the /a/ vowel. The Perfect aspect is indicated
                    by the /e/ vowel. The Progressive aspect is indicated by the
                    /u/ vowel. The Perfect Progressive aspect is indicated by
                    the /o/ vowel. The Habitual aspect is indicated by the /i/
                    vowel.</p>

                    <h3>Voice</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan has 3 voices: Active, Static Passive, and Dynamic
                    Passive. The active voice is indicated by the lack of a
                    symbol on the tail. The static passive voice is indicated by
                    a doubled tail. The dynamic passive voice is indicated by a
                    slashed tail. </p>

                    <h3>Mood</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan has 3 moods: Indicative, Imperative, and
                    Interrogative. The indicative mood is indicated by a tail on
                    the right. The imperative mood is indicated by a tail on the
                    left. The interrogative mood is indicated by a tail on both
                    sides. </p>

                    <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>

                    <h3>Word Order</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan mandates an Object-Subject-Verb word order.
                    Adjectives appear before the nouns they modify, while
                    adverbs appear after the verbs they modify. Note that words
                    can be identified by ending with a non-empty coda. As such,
                    Shmigan does not use spaces. </p>

                    <h3>Subordinate Clauses</h3>

                    <p>Subordinate clauses are inserted as if they were a single
                    noun. They can be identified when a sentence appears to have
                    too many nouns (without listing conjunctions). </p>

                    <h3>Plurality and Possessivity</h3>

                    <p>A plural is made by making the final vowel of a word 'a'
                    and appending the /s/ coda. Possessivity uses a final vowel
                    of 'i' instead. No accordances must be made in either
                    case. If a word is both plural and possessive, the plural
                    ending is added first (leading to the ending 'asis')</p>

                    <h3>Punctuation</h3>

                    <p>Shmigan does not use spaces. Instead, words can be
                    identified easily as all words end in a consonant, which
                    will have nothing in its bucket.</p>

                    <p>Punctuation is indicated by adding a slash inside the
                    tail of a symbol. There are, in total, 9 different
                    punctuation marks. They are: </p>
